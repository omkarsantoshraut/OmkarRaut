                        Technology plays a vital role in the life of each and every human today, and today's humans also can't live comfortably without technology.
                        Of course, there are many new things came up that are useful to the people, and they help people to do the work with high accuracy,
                        and in a very small amount of time. Since technology makes the things easy for people, they are using it and always ready to adopt the new technology.
                        Some people just surprises by seeing the new technologies, and they are feeling proud of them. The Alexa is a good example of that. Some people
                        says that it is not a live thing, still it replies to the humans and do the work as per the human instructions. Almost all technologies makes 
                        the human work easy and more accurate. Hence, we should adopt the technologies and should use them for the betterment. Today, we are living in the 
                        <b>21<sup>st</sup> century</b>. This century, considered as the century of science and technology. Humans are making the new things for his comfort
                        and to make the things faster. A few years ago, when the mobile was not there, the life of the human was very slow and excruciating. There is a 
                        huge difference in the life of today and the life at that time.

                                I like the new technologies, because these makes my work easy, fast, and more accurate. As this century is of science 
                                and technology, and I love to make new things that will make the human's work more accurate and simple, I have selected
                                computer engineering as a bachelor course to learn the things about creation of new technologies. I have learned and also learning many new 
                                things that will help me in future to build a new technology. I love to work on the latest technologies such as data science, artificial
                                intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and the list goes on.

                                Today, in the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen the examples that are totally based on the new technologies. Some organizations have made a
                                new drones to the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccines within the less time. Also, we have seen the COVID-19 vaccine registration and certification
                                process. All people prefer to work digitally and try to make the things faster and easier. Along with using the new technology, I love to create 
                                new and give it to the people. Hence, I want to achieve a position that will help me to use my skills, knowledge, and experience for the creation
                                 of new technologies using advanced technologies. Technology today is evolving at such a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress, causing 
                                an acceleration of the rate of change, until eventually, it will become exponential. However, it is not only technology trends and top 
                                technologies that are evolving, a lot more has changed this year due to the outbreak of COVID-19 making IT professionals realize that 
                                their role will not stay the same in the contactless world tomorrow. And an IT professional in 2020-21 will constantly be learning, 
                                unlearning, and relearning. Change is the only constant. This applies to the professional life of all as well. Upskilling yourself is a need
                                nowadays, the reason is pretty simple, technology is evolving very quickly. We need to identify and invest our time in the top trending
                                technologies which will attract a huge market in upcoming days.

                        We know the phrase, 'due date' (अति तिथे माती). This applies to the technology also. If we overuse the technology then it is very harmful
                        to us. Hence, we should use the things in particular limit. The major disadvantage of new technologies is the people becomes lasy and 
                        don't want to work, and it it very harful for the health. Also, these things have destroying the natural beauty and the human's nature.
                        So, we should use these latest technologies within a particular limit and should not overuse. I am inspired by a sentence and that 
                        sentence always motivates me to do the new things and create new things for the betterment of the society. The sentence is as follows.
                        <br><br>
                        <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="200" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom" data-aos-duration="2000">"A small positive thought at early morning can change the entire outcome of the whole day!"</p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    

                    

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6 p-5">
                            <p style="text-align:left;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="200" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom" data-aos-duration="2000">
                                I really fall in love of this sentence, and alwways try to do positive thinking at morning. I got much positive energy whenever I try it
                                at morning, and this statement is responsible for one of the my skill that is <b>always do something new</b>. I will recomend that you 
                                should try it and I am sure that you will get a much advantage from it.
                            </p>
        
                            <p style="text-indent: 15%; text-align:left;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="200" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom" data-aos-duration="2000">
                                Some people always want to do work and want to build a good profile for their bright future. But they face some problems and then 
                                come down and finally leave. Actually then are having the ability to do the things but there may be the lack of good management, or
                                may be the other reason. But I believe that problems will come in every field and we have to solve them and go ahead, and the idea to
                                solve the problems will come from the positive thinking. I have tried many time, actually I use to think on the problem on early morning
                                that I have faced yesterday and I was unable to solve it. Whenever I think on early morning, I got the solution, and solution will be 
                                simple, optimized, and creative. Try it out.

                        Some people wants to do much more and they are having a proper management. But they are affected with something and unable to give a proper
                        time for the work. They just says I will do it tomorrow or day after tomorrow, and always give refuses. If we want to make progress in any particular
                        field, then we should not give the refuses. We should keep in mind the sentence of Sant Kabir which is as follows. <br>
                        <p>
                            <a href="img/kaal.jpg"  target="_blank"> <img src="img/kaal.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" target="_blank" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="200" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom" data-aos-duration="2000"></a>
                        </p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 15%; text-align:left;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="200" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-bottom" data-aos-duration="2000">
                        It means, we should not keep the work pending. If possible, we should do the tomorrow's work today and today's work right now.
                        If you are not doing work right now, then when will you do? Once the time will gone, you can't do anything. So, I recommend that 
                        put this statement in mind and do work accordingly. At last, I would like to say that perform well in your field and do the work
                        that will help to the society. Also, want to give the best wishes to you for your future work and for your healthy life.
                    </p>
