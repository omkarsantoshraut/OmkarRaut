                            Throughout the internship, I maintained a strong sense of curiosity. I was eager to learn new concepts, tools, and techniques as Data Science is a rapidly evolving field.

                                    I learned a new technology called Dash. Dash was a data visualization and UI library developed by Plotly, and it allowed us to build interactive dashboards with multiple graphs for data analytics using only Python. I incorporated Dash into the project I was working on during my internship.
                                    had to start with the basics and then gradually applied my knowledge to the project. In the dashboard, I included various types of graphs, such as a live map that displayed the current locations of the vehicles, a pie chart illustrating the current status of the vehicles (running, stopped, idle, etc.), a heatmap showcasing the distance traveled by vehicles over time on the selected date, and a bar chart depicting the vehicles and their respective total distances traveled on that day.

                            ✅ Developed the machine learning model to predict the position of the charging station based on the vehicle locations only if there is a requirement.
                            <br>
                            ✅ Developed a supervised machine learning model to predict the efficiency of vehicles from provided inputs. The data that I used was time series and hence I used resampling to convert the data in the same frequency.
                            <br>
                            ✅ Developed a part of a data analytics platform for the organization's employees as well as for users. In that, I had added features like making a different kinds of graphs (scatter plot, line plot, heat map, etc) for any number of vehicles by just selecting them. Also, that platform was able to show the actual location of all vehicles on the map.
                            <br>
                            ✅ A platform that will take starting and destination addresses and plot the shortest route with colored points on it that mention the efficiency of vehicles on that route using past history of vehicles. Also, it was able to show extra information on the screen such as expected time, total distance, average speed based on the past data, etc.
                            <br>
                            ✅ Developed a back end that will suggest the charging station locations based on the routes of vehicles. Also, it will optimize the number of charging stations based on the demand, distance, etc.
                            <br>
                            ✅ Developed some python scripts that helped in automation of working of the testing team.

                            As this is very different from my field, I have taken this opportunity to achieve an experience in some other fields that will help me in the 
                            future. During an internship, I got a chance to talk with many people which have belongs to different backgrounds. Also, I have taken some meetings
                            with the team of HRs and got an amazing experience regarding how to talk in the meeting, how to put our point confidently in front of the teammates,
                            how to ask questions in a meeting and few more. During this period, I also got a chance to talk with the freshers and we have talk on the technologies
                            in their fields and what they know right now. That helps me a lot to increase my knowledge in different fields.

                        Also, I have got a letter of recommendation for the better performance during an internship. I must say that I have got many
                        new and helpful things from this internship.

                    <div style="font-size: 18px;">
                        I have an interest in the field of data science, and hence I had started my data science journey from the one month internship in the 
                        field of data science. Data science is a mixture of mathematics and logic, machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, etc. 
                        I had learnt about them but I wanted to get some experience by working on the projects and I got a chance to do an internship at The Sparks
                        Foundations. Along with my learning process, I have done the tasks provided by the team from the organization. I would like to list down the tasks in brief.
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Prediction using supervised machine learning:</b>
                                <p>
                                    The problem statement was very simple. I had to predict the percentage of student in an exam based on the number of hours
                                    he/she has done the study. They had provided the test data and it had only two attributes such as nunber of hours of study and
                                    the percentage in an exam. I had to make a machine learning model that can predict the percentage of a student. Also, I had to 
                                    submit the answers of some questions. They had given some question and based on that information I had to use the trained model 
                                    and give the answers of that questions. That's all. This was the first very simple task that I had done. I had made a model by using 
                                    simple linear regression from scratch as well as using sklearn library.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Prediction using unsupervised machine learning:</b>
                                <p>
                                    The second problem was very straightforward. I had given the iris dataset. I had to use only input features  to train the model
                                    and find out the optimized clusters in the given data i.e. I had to find out the number of classes of flower in the data. Also, 
                                    I had to visualize it by making the graph. I had used KMeans clustering algorithm to find the number of classes of flower. I have started from
                                    1 to 10 as a number of classes and based on that I had developed the KMeans models and store the error (mean squared error) of each iteration.
                                    Then I had plotted the graph number of classes VS error. I had got 3 as an optimized value of classes. Then I had developed a KMeans model by
                                    using 3 value of clusters. After that I had used matplotlib library to visualize it and shown the clusters with different colors.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail</b>
                                <p>
                                    In this task, I had to make a dashboard based on the given data as a part of data analytics. I had used Tableau and made an interactive 
                                    dashboard to visualize the given data. Now, I have learnt a new technology to make an interactive dashboards in python only. The name of the
                                    technology is Dash, which is developed by Plotly. It is very easy to use Dash and the main thing is that we can use it in any web framework. 
                                    I have recently used it with Flask framework for on the projects.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism</b>
                                <p>
                                    This task also very similar to the above. I had given a dataset in csv format. I had to do the data cleaning first, and then I had to do
                                    the exploratory data analysis. I had imported the csv file in the jupyter notebook, and then I have done data cleaning. After that I had saved 
                                    the new data into the another csv file. Then I had imported that file into Tableau and had done the data analytics. There were some question I had to
                                    submit after building an interactive dashboard. I had done with that also.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports</b>
                                <p>
                                    Again the same think I had to do. The only difference was that the dataset was different than the previous one. I had done with it using
                                    the Tableau and the python script.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm</b>
                                <p>
                                    In this problem, I had to use decision tree classifier and train a machine learning model that will classify the thing after providing a new input.
                                    I had done with it, and at last I had to make a diagram of decision tree. I had learnt it first, and then I was able to make it using python only.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    In this problem, they had provided the COVID-19 dataset. I had to do a timeline analysis of the data. I had make an interactive dashboard 
                                    in Tableau using that data with respect to the time. It was very interesting to work on the current problems. I was like a real world 
                                    problem, I had enjoyed the duration of working on this problem.
