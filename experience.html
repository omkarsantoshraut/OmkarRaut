                    Internships are only the experience for the fresher people like me. Internships provide the industrial environment, knowledge, 
                    current technologies information, and experience. During an internship, we will learn ne things, use them in the real time project and
                    also we will use our past knowledge to develop the things. We will get a training also from the industry experts and that will increase
                    the knowledge of the freshers and improve the mentality to work in an industry.

                    Along with the nowledge related to the field, we will get an environment to work in an industry that will automatically 
                    increase the communication, personality, group discussion, public speaking and many more good skills. Also, we will get a 
                    knowledge of how to explain our point in the team and how to reply to the people who are from different field of study.
                    Internship is only an option to the freshers to get an experience in the field in which they want to make their career.
                    The main advantage of internships is that you may get a job offer from the same organization if your performance is good 
                    during an internship.
                     And hence internships plays a vital role in the life of each fresher. <br> <b>I have listed my experience as an intern in the

                        After achieving the knowledge of machine learning, data visualization, data analytics, data cleaning, and feature engineering
                        I had applied for the position of data science at inGO Electric Pvt. Ltd. I am very lucky that the inGO Electric gives me a chnace 
                        to work with them as an intern. I have learned many new things here according to the requirements of the projects and also used them
                        in the ongoing project.

                                I had learned a new technology called <b>Dash</b>. Dash is a data visualization and UI library developed by Plotly
                                and we can build interactive dashboards with multiple graphs for data analytics using the python only. Had made an interactive 
                                dashboards in the project that we were doing there and I had used Dash there. I have learnt the Dash from basics and now using in the 
                                project. In the dashboard, included the graphs such as live map that will show the current location of the vehicles, pie chart
                                that will show the current status of the vehicle like running, stopped, idle, etc. Also, I had shown the heatmap of the distance travelled
                                by vehicles with time on the selected date, and the bar chart of the vehicles and the total distance travelled on that day. All graphs were
                                interactive. If we select a particular part of any graph then all the graphs will change accordingly. This is a power of Dash and that's
                                why I have learnt it.

                <div style="font-size: 18px;">
                    I have an interest in the field of data science, and hence I had started my data science journey from the one month internship in the 
                    field of data science. Data science is a mixture of mathematics and logic, machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, etc. 
                    I had learnt about them but I wanted to get some experience by working on the projects and I got a chance to do an internship at The Sparks
                    Foundations. Along with my learning process, I have done the tasks provided by the team from the organization. I would like to list down the tasks in brief.
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Prediction using supervised machine learning:</b>
                            <p>
                                The problem statement was very simple. I had to predict the percentage of student in an exam based on the number of hours
                                he/she has done the study. They had provided the test data and it had only two attributes such as nunber of hours of study and
                                the percentage in an exam. I had to make a machine learning model that can predict the percentage of a student. Also, I had to 
                                submit the answers of some questions. They had given some question and based on that information I had to use the trained model 
                                and give the answers of that questions. That's all. This was the first very simple task that I had done. I had made a model by using 
                                simple linear regression from scratch as well as using sklearn library.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Prediction using unsupervised machine learning:</b>
                            <p>
                                The second problem was very straightforward. I had given the iris dataset. I had to use only input features  to train the model
                                and find out the optimized clusters in the given data i.e. I had to find out the number of classes of flower in the data. Also, 
                                I had to visualize it by making the graph. I had used KMeans clustering algorithm to find the number of classes of flower. I have started from
                                1 to 10 as a number of classes and based on that I had developed the KMeans models and store the error (mean squared error) of each iteration.
                                Then I had plotted the graph number of classes VS error. I had got 3 as an optimized value of classes. Then I had developed a KMeans model by
                                using 3 value of clusters. After that I had used matplotlib library to visualize it and shown the clusters with different colors.

                            <p>
                                In this task, I had to make a dashboard based on the given data as a part of data analytics. I had used Tableau and made an interactive 
                                dashboard to visualize the given data. Now, I have learnt a new technology to make an interactive dashboards in python only. The name of the
                                technology is Dash, which is developed by Plotly. It is very easy to use Dash and the main thing is that we can use it in any web framework. 
                                I have recently used it with Flask framework for on the projects.

                            <p>
                                This task also very similar to the above. I had given a dataset in csv format. I had to do the data cleaning first, and then I had to do
                                the exploratory data analysis. I had imported the csv file in the jupyter notebook, and then I have done data cleaning. After that I had saved 
                                the new data into the another csv file. Then I had imported that file into Tableau and had done the data analytics. There were some question I had to
                                submit after building an interactive dashboard. I had done with that also.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                Again the same think I had to do. The only difference was that the dataset was different than the previous one. I had done with it using
                                the Tableau and the python script.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In this problem, I had to use decision tree classifier and train a machine learning model that will classify the thing after providing a new input.
                                I had done with it, and at last I had to make a diagram of decision tree. I had learnt it first, and then I was able to make it using python only.

                            <b>Timeline Analysis : Covid-19</b>
                            <p>
                                In this problem, they had provided the COVID-19 dataset. I had to do a timeline analysis of the data. I had make an interactive dashboard 
                                in Tableau using that data with respect to the time. It was very interesting to work on the current problems. I was like a real world 
                                problem, I had enjoyed the duration of working on this problem.
